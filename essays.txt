Where I come from is a small island, where the trees are taller than buildings. For many years, I have been envious of the advantageous life that I thought big city residents had. Turns out, I have been lucky enough to experience what it feels like to build meaningful and reliable relationships with my school communities and neighbors. However, most people I grew up with dwell in complacency and comfort, unable to grow as a person, whereas people in large cities are naturally exposed to diverse thinking. If I had a chance to host a podcast, I would talk about how both small towns and bigger cities can learn from each other.
 
The fruit of life varies from person to person, but I think it comes from having true intimacy with your communities and being able to embrace differences. As much as it’s incredibly easy to be influenced to have small goals and believe in recycled values, it’s important to expand one’s knowledge. Our education, resources, and career opportunities are certainly not at all close to the amount that big cities have, but the amount of genuine care and support I received from the people around me encouraged me to create an unapologetic self-identity and create multiple service projects to reciprocate the kindness. 

I want the lives of big cities to know that they can always take a step back and realize they have an opportunity to trust, care, and give. For the lives of small towns, I want them to widen their horizons and step outside of their comfort.
